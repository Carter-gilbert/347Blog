    <h1>Week 12 - November 19th</h1>

    <p>This week we learned how to incorporate API calls with react js. We learned how to make a store which allows us to change states and ultimately have a callback and dispatcher that will wait for the API to send the data before moving on. This removes errors caused by code using data that has not yet been received from the API.  We also read about multi page apps which can be made using the react router. The example from the reading was a little confusing so I decided to find some external sources to clarify some things.  </p>
    <p>We first need to make a Router component with a switch statement inside to specify the pages we would like to switch between (the code below is a portion of the code required). As you can see each page needs its own route and path so react knows how to redirect. </p>
    <code>
        <pre>
        &#60;Switch>
            &#60;Route exact path="/">
                    &#60;Home />
                  &#60;/Route>
                &#60;Route path="/about">
                    &#60;About />
                  &#60;/Route>
        &#60;/Switch>
        </pre>
    </code>

    <p>Now we need a way to actually navigate to each page, for a real website you would likely make it look nice, but for this proof of concept we can simple use the code below. Each method is for one page and all it does is make a heading. If you wanted more on the page you would use this method to add it. Essentially what goes into the return is the HTML (or js) you want to display on the screen. This is different than how we have given HTML paths in the past, but this enables us to have multiple dynamic pages.  </p>

<pre>
    <code>
    function Home() {
        return (
        &#60;div>
            &#60;h2>Home Page&#60;/h2>
        &#60;/div>
        );
      }
          
      function About() {
        return (
        &#60;div>
            &#60;h2>About Page&#60;/h2>
        &#60;/div>
        );
      }
    </code>
</pre>
