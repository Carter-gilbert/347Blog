    <h1>Week 1 - September 3rd</h1>
    <p> &emsp;This week I started off by learning some history about the internet and its creation. The internet as we
        know it
        began as a project funded by the United States government where the members of Advanced Research Projects Agency
        (ARPA) wanted to create a link between computers without using the telephone network. The telephone network was
        unsuitable for this link as, at the time, it ran on dedicated circuits meaning each connection required its own
        circuit which would cause many issues. If one circuit went down all of the connections that rely on that circuit
        will also go down this method would also become extremely expensive with an increasing number of circuits needed
        as
        more devices link. ARPA instead went with a technology called <q>Packet Switching</q>, where the computer would
        split the
        data, it wanted to send into small pieces of data called packets, then these packets would be directed by a
        router
        to their destination. This network would later expand to Europe and be adopted by so many private industries it
        would not need government funding. </p>

    <p> &emsp;Although the history of the internet may be interesting, I always have preferred learning how the web
        pages we
        access
        daily are coded. Many of these web pages are coded in HTML, a relatively simple language that most of the
        internet
        uses. We had a brief overview of HTML in the reading and got to apply what we had learned in Lab2. This lab
        started
        off by making us do some simple formatting, but once we had gotten used to the p and h1 tags we were introduced
        to
        the anchor tag and how to use href. We initially used it to navigate between different parts of a tall list. The
        user would select the letter they wanted to navigate to, and the code would take them to the reference to that
        letter. Later we learned how to use href to navigate to an external webpage. Finally moved on to definition
        lists
        where we learned another way to format a list of items by using the list definition, definition term, and
        definition
        description tag together. </p>

    <p>
        &emsp;After looking at my lackluster index.html page I wanted to learn how to do some basic styling. I was able
        to
        find a few sources, linked below, that helped me learn the basics. I am waiting until we learn some of these
        concepts in class to ensure that my implementation is correct. This is how I learned that CSS is how you style
        HTML pages. You can put CSS inline by typing “style=” or you can create a separate external CSS file where you
        can have a list of styles and use them in the HTML code as needed. CSS allows you to do things such as <span
            style="color:blue">change font color</span>, <span style="font-size: large;">change
            font size</span>, or <span style="font-weight: bold;">make text bold</span> in order to make web pages more
        visually appealing. I am very
        excited to learn more about CSS and incorporate it into my blog and other projects.
