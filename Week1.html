<Title>Week 1</Title>
<h1>Week 1</h1>
<p>This week I started off by learning some history about the internet and its creation. The internet as we know it
    began as a project funded by the United States government where the members of Advanced Research Projects Agency
    (ARPA) wanted to create a link between computers without using the telephone network. The telephone network was
    unsuitable for this link as, at the time, it ran on dedicated circuits meaning each connection required its own
    circuit which would cause many issues. If one circuit went down all of the connections that rely on that circuit
    will also go down this method would also become extremely expensive with an increasing number of circuits needed as
    more devices link. ARPA instead went with a technology called “Packet Switching”, where the computer would split the
    data, it wanted to send into small pieces of data called packets, then these packets would be directed by a router
    to their destination. This network would later expand to Europe and be adopted by so many private industries it
    would not need government funding. </p>

<p>Although the history of the internet may be interesting, I always have preferred learning how the web pages we access
    daily are coded. Many of these web pages are coded in HTML, a relatively simple language that most of the internet
    uses. We had a brief overview of HTML in the reading and got to apply what we had learned in Lab2. This lab started
    off by making us do some simple formatting, but once we had gotten used to the p and h1 tags we were introduced to
    the anchor tag and how to use href. We initially used it to navigate between different parts of a tall list. The
    user would select the letter they wanted to navigate to, and the code would take them to the reference to that
    letter. Later we learned how to use href to navigate to an external webpage. Finally moved on to definition lists
    where we learned another way to format a list of items by using the list definition, definition term, and definition
    description tag together. </p>
