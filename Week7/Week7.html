    <h1>Week 7 - October 15th</h1>

    <p>This week we have continued to study JavaScript and began to make and use endpoints in express. Some of these topics were a little difficult to understand so I spent a lot of time working on that leaving less time for the blog. For my blog this week
        I wanted to loop back to something we had mentioned earlier when we were working on project 1, forms. We have made forms before, but I wanted to learn how to accept the data and save it as a json file. At this point I understand how a json file
        is formatted and how it is posted to a server but I didn’t know how this would work with actual HTML elements. What we need to do is make a form, as we have in the past, but assign an id so that we can grab the value in JavaScript. For example:
    </p>



    <code>
        <pre>

            &#60;form&#62;
                &#60;label for="name">Name:&#60;/label&#62;
                &#60;input type="text" id="name" name="name" value="Name"&#62;
                &#60;label for="email">Email:&#60;/label&#62;
                &#60;input type="email" id="email" name="email" value="Email"&#62;
            &#60;/form&#62;

        </pre>
    </code>

    <br>
    <p>Notice how each part of the form has an id= so that when we code the JavaScript we can grab each of these elements and extract their values. We can use the getElementByID in JavaScript to get the elements by their ID name or email. We can do this
        by using .value to retrieve the data currently in each input element. Lastly, we append this data to an array so that it can be stored we could also format it into a JSON array, but for this example, we are simply putting it into an array for
        proof of concept as once you have the data in an array it is easy to reformat into JSON. </p>
    <code>
        <pre>
            data.append("name", document.getElementById("name").value);
            data.append("email", document.getElementById("email").value);
        </pre>
    </code>

    <br>
    <p>Then we also need to add one more thing, the keyword action="/handle-form" method="post” in our form HTML code. This is assuming that the web server we connect to has a handle-form class with a post method so that it can accept the values from the
        client once they are entered into the form and a button is clicked to submit and trigger the action. Once this communication is established, we are able to move data from the client to the server upon the press of a button completing the data
        retrieval from a form. </p>
