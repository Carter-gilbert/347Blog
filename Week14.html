    <h1>Week 13 - December 10th</h1>

    <p>If I was teaching CS 347 next semester, I would change several things. First, I would spend less time on HTML and CSS and focus more on JavaScript. I know this class is designed for beginners so there is more time allocated for HTML and CSS, but everyone I talked to thought that this portion of the class was easy and that there was too much time allocated. This is the opposite for the JavaScript portion of the class which felt rushed and thus was confusing. I felt that I learned more about JavaScript during the react portion of the course than I did on the JavaScript portion. Project2 also felt a little rushed as the project was due the same day the reading which we needed to finish the assignment was due. The pacing for the react portion was perfect, so I feel if there was one less week on HTML CSS and that time was put toward JavaScript the pacing of the class would be perfect.  </p>
    <p>I really liked the labs throughout the course as I felt they often paired well with the reading so I would continue to use these in combination with the “textbook” that you made. I also enjoyed working with a partner as when things got confusing, we were able to work together and figure them out. I also found the peer reviews to be incredibly helpful, I got my friends to test my websites but they are not taking the course so having a couple people able to give specific feedback was often very beneficial to the final product.  </p>
    <p>The last thing I want to touch on is the blogs. In the beginning, I felt they were very helpful for learning some new parts of HTML and CSS, but as the weeks went on, they felt less and less helpful. Personally, I find it more useful to research as I am working on a project so I can apply it immediately, however, I understand that the more effort you put into the blog the more you can get out of them. For this reason, I believe next semester I would have a blog due every week, but I would drop the 2 lowest blog grades so that students may take 2 weeks off a blog or post an extra one if their blog for one week did not earn them full credit.  </p>
