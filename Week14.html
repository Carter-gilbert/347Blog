    <h1>Week 13 - December 3rd</h1>

    <p>If I was teaching CS 347 next semester, I would change several things. First, I would spend less time on HTML and CSS and focus more on JavaScript. I know this class is designed for beginners so there is more time allocated for HTML and CSS, but everyone I talked to thought that this portion of the class was easy and that there was too much time allocated. This is the opposite for the JavaScript portion of the class which felt rushed and thus was confusing. I felt that I learned more about JavaScript during the react portion of the course than I did on the JavaScript portion. Project2 also felt a little rushed as the project was due the same day the reading which we needed to finish the assignment was due. The pacing for the react portion was perfect, so I feel if there was one less week on HTML CSS and that time was put toward JavaScript the pacing of the class would be perfect.  </p>
