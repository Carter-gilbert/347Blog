    <h1>Week 11 - November 12th</h1>
    
    <p>This week we have continued our study of React JS and focused on components as well as states. We learned that states are essentially variables that can be changed by using a setter method. These methods can then be put into other methods and passed to components where they can then change the variables. This may seem a little complicated at first, but it makes sense after doing it a few times. This week I have done a lot of general reading about React JS, but for this blog I will be discussing what I have learned about state. The first article I found discussed the difference between state and props. From the lab I knew they were different and in fact worked hand in hand. What I learned was SetState is asynchronous meaning calls do not immediately rerender to the screen. You need to pass an updater function as a prop if you want the variable to change and rerender immediately. Here is an example of a set state declaration with an updater function. </p>
    <code>
        <pre>
            const [var, setVar ] = useState('');
            const updateVar = var => {
            setSelectedImg(var);
            }
        </pre>
    </code>
